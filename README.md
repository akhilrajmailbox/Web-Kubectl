## Two Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator

I set up [SSH two factor authentication on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/ssh-two-factor-authentication-ubuntu-16-04-google-authenticator) server using the well-known Google Authenticator. Once you set it up, the security of your SSH server will be hugely increased.

Two factor authentication, also known as two-step verification, requires you to enter two pieces of information in order to login. Google Authenticator generates a one-time password using a shared secret key and the current time. Not only do you need to provide the correct username and password, but also have to enter a one-time password generated by Google Authenticator to log in to your SSH server.


After your deployment, check the logs for the deployment and scan the QR Code / take the key with `Google Authenticator` application on your phone, thats it. done...!
